    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language <abbr title="HTML">(HTML)</abbr></strong> is the standard markup language for
        creating web pages and web applications.</p>

    <p> Web browsers receive <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> documents from a web server or from local storage and render
        the documents into multimedia web pages. <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> describes the structure of a web page
        semantically and originally
        included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    <p><abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> elements are the building blocks of <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr>. pages. With
        <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> provides a means to
        create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
        <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> elements are delineated by <dfn>tags</dfn>, written using angle brackets. Tags
        such as <span>&lt;img /></span>and <span>&lt;input /></span> directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span>&lt;p/></span>
        surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
        display the <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <p><abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their
        attributes),
        character-based data types, character references and entity references. <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> tags most
        commonly come in pairs
        like <span>&lt;h1/></span> and <span>&lt;h1/></span>, although some represent empty elements and so are
        unpaired, for example <span>&lt;img/></span>. The first tag in
        such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the <dfn>end tag</dfn> (they are also called opening tags and
        closing tags).</p>
    <p>Another important components is the <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> <dfn>document type declaration,</dfn>which
        triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
